**Paper**: "An Adaptive Fusion-Based Data Augmentation Method for Abstract Dialogue Summarization."  

This study used two publicly available datasets for the experiments: **DialogSum** and **SAMSum**. These datasets are available for academic research and can be obtained from the relevant project pages or public repositories.

Here are the download links for the two publicly available dialogue summarization datasets mentionedï¼š

### **Project Structure**

This repository is organized as follows:

- **AAF\\_1_fenju\\**  
  _Data Processing_: Splitting dialogue texts into the format "Speaker: Dialogue" to facilitate information extraction and generation.

- **AAF\\_2_1_SR\\**  
  _Data Augmentation_: Synonym Replacement (SR).

- **AAF\\_2_2_action_extraction\\**  
  **AAF\\_2_2_topic_annotation\\**  
  **AAF\\_2_2_ATGEN\\**  
  _Data Augmentation_: Sequential processes for Action Extraction, Topic Segmentation, and Topic-Action-Based Dialogue Generation Enhancement.

- **AAF\\Trend_split\\**  
  _Fusion Process_: Dataset splitting mechanism for good and bad data during the fusion process.

- **AAF\\train_bart.py**  
  _Model Training_: Adaptive fusion augmentation on the BART model.
